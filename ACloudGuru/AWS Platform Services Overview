*   An Availability zone (AZ) is simply a datacenter.
*   AWS Edge Network Locations are end points for AWS, which are used of caching the content. Typically this consists of CloudFront,    
    Amazon's Content Delivery Network (CDN).

There were 16 regions (as of 2017 December) and 42 availability zones. 
In 2018, 6 more regions and 17 more availability zones will be added.
