Following Use case uses Amazon S3, Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB and SNS services.

* user clicks on website url that is  stored in S3. 
* The user can hit submit after entering the data.
* It goes thru Amazon API Gateway and triggers a Lambda function.
* Lambda function stores the data onto DynamoDB and pass the same data onto Amazon SNS Queue.
* The data on Amazon SNS acts as a trigger for another SNS function and takes this data and pass it to Amazon Polly service.
* Amazon converts this text onto mp3 file and then the same Lambda function stores this mp3 file in S3 bucket. Also update the DynamoDB as 
  the job is completed.
* User can be able to search on the website and the request goes thru the Amazon Gateway.
* It triggers another Lambda function which gets all the posts stored in DynamoDB.

Solution: First extract the PollyLabResources zip file.
1. Change the region to N.Verginia, as it is one of the region that fully supports Alexa skills.
2. Create a DynamoDB table called posts with primary key id.
3. Go to S3, and create a bucket helpvenkateshstudyawspolly.com and configure the bucket as static website by going to properties of the
   bucket, and Static website hosting.
   a. configure index.html and error.html
4. Create another bucket called pollymp3storagemybucket.
5. Create a role to communicate with all of these services. Go to IAM, 
   a. Create a Lambda Role.
   b. Create a custom policy and copy the json data from lambdajsonpolicy.json file from above extracted file and paste on the JSON editor.
   c. Give the name as myLamdaPollyPolicy and create policy.
   d. Go back to IAM and create a Lambda role. Attach the myLamdaPollyPolicy that is created earlier to the role During Permissions. 
   e. Give the name as myLambdaPollyRole and hit create role.
6. Go to S3 bucket helpvenkateshstudyawspolly.com permissions and select bucket policy. Paste the json data from
   bucketpolicypermissions.json file.
7. Go to Simple Notification Service (SNS) and create a topic with name new_posts and SNSPoly.
8. Creating Lambda Functions:
   a. First Lambda function:
      1. Author from scratch, with name PostReader_NewPosts, Runtime Python 2.7, Choose an existing role called myLambdaPollyRole and
         select Create. This shows the above resources that are created earlier and it can access to. 
      2. Paste the code from NewPosts.py onto the Lambda Function IDE below on this window and hit save.
      3. Pass the Environment variables DB_TABLE_NAME value posts and SNS_TOPIC value is arn of new_posts.
      4. Go to Basic settings and give description and hit save.
      5. Click on Test button, copy and paste data from sample.json; Leave default Event template and give Event name as HelloJoanna.
      6. Click on Test and then Details. This data should be inserted to DynamoDB table posts.
      7. Go to DynamoDB table posts and click on Item to see the data.
   b. Second Lambda function:
      1. Author from scratch, with name PostReader_ConvertToAudio, Runtime Python 2.7, Choose an existing role called myLambdaPollyRole
         and select Create. This shows the above resources that are created earlier and it can access to. 
      2. Add code from converttoaudio.py file. Add the environment variable names DB_TABLE_NAME value posts, BUCKET_NAME value 
         pollymp3storagemybucket and hit save button. Go to Basic Settings, give description and Timeout to 5 minutes.
      3. Add SNS trigger and click on Configuration Required. Select new_posts in the topic dropdown box. Click Add and hit Save.
   c. Third Lambda function:
      1. Author from scratch, with name PostReader_GetPosts, Runtime Python 2.7, Choose an existing role called myLambdaPollyRole
         and select Create. This shows the above resources that are created earlier and it can access to. 
      2. Copy the code from getposts.py. Add the environment variable DB_TABLE_NAME and value. Hit Save.
      3. Click on Test button. Give Event name getPosts. Change the json to "postId","*". Hit Create button. Hit Test button again.
         Click on Details and see the content.
 9. Creating a GateWay: Select Create new API and give name as PostReaderAPI, give some description and leave default Endpoint Type as
      Regional. Click on Create API Button. Create a method, Select Get method and in Setup add lamd=bda function as PostReader_GetPosts
      Select Save.
      Add post method from create function in Actions of API Gateway. Select PostReader_NewPosts lambda function and hit save.
      Select Enable Cores, Select Enable Cores and Replace Existing button. This will give OPTIONS method to interact.
      Select Get Method and select Method Request. Select URL Query String Parameter. Add Query String postId.
      Select Get method and select Integration Request and select Body Mapping Templates. Select When there are no templates defined
      option. Add application/json in Content Type. Select this and add the data from mapping.json file. Hit Save.
      Click on /. Select Deploy API from Actions. Deployment stage is new stage, remaining fields as prod and click deploy.
      Copy the Invoke url from there and paste in API_ENDPOINT in javascript file scripts.js. 
 10. Go to S3 bucket helpvenkateshstudyawspolly.com and upload the files scripts.js, index.html and styles.css
     Select the url from index.html to open the webpage.
