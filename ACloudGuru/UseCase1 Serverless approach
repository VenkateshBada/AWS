Following Use case uses Amazon S3, Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB and SNS services.

* user clicks on website url that is  stored in S3. 
* The user can hit submit after entering the data.
* It goes thru Amazon API Gateway and triggers a Lambda function.
* Lambda function stores the data onto DynamoDB and pass the same data onto Amazon SNS Queue.
* The data on Amazon SNS acts as a trigger for another SNS function and takes this data and pass it to Amazon Polly service.
* Amazon converts this text onto mp3 file and then the same Lambda function stores this mp3 file in S3 bucket. Also update the DynamoDB as 
  the job is completed.
* User can be able to search on the website and the request goes thru the Amazon Gateway.
* It triggers another Lambda function which gets all the posts stored in DynamoDB.

Solution: First extract the PollyLabResources zip file.
1. Change the region to N.Verginia, as it is one of the region that fully supports Alexa skills.

3. Go to S3, and create a bucket helpvenkateshstudyawspolly.com and configure the bucket as static website by going to properties of the
   bucket, and Static website hosting.
   a. configure index.html and error.html
4. Create another bucket called pollymp3storagemybucket.
5. Create a role to communicate with all of these services. Go to IAM, 
   a. Create a Lambda Role.
   b. Create a custom policy and copy the json data from lambdajsonpolicy.json file from above extracted file and paste on the JSON editor.
   c. Give the name as myLamdaPollyPolicy and create policy.
   d. Go back to IAM and create a Lambda role. Attach the myLamdaPollyPolicy that is created earlier to the role During Permissions. 
   e. Give the name as myLambdaPollyRole and hit create role.

   bucketpolicypermissions.json file.
7. Go to Simple Notification Service (SNS) and create a topic with name new_posts and SNSPoly.
8. Creating Lambda Functions:
   a. First Lambda function Author from scrath, with name PostReader_NewPosts, Runtime Python 2.7, Choose an existing role called
