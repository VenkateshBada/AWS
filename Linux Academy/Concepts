IAM (Identity and Access Management): 
=====================================
IAM is where you manage your AWS users and access to their AWS accounts and services. The common use of IAM is to manage:
  Users
  Groups
  IAM Access Policies
  Roles
Root user is the one which was created during AWS account creation. By default, root user will have full rights and access to every part 
  of the account. For all other users (except root user), permissions must be given that access to AWS services.
When a new AWS root account is created, it is best practice to complete the tasks listed in IAM under Security Status.
   * Delete your root access keys
   * Activate MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) on your root account
   * Create individual IAM users
   * User groups to assign permissions
   * Apply an IAM password policy
AWS best practice is to NEVER use root account for day-to-day use. If full Admin access is needed then create an IAM user and attach the
    AdministratorAccess policy to it.
It can often be more convinient and setup groups and assign permissions to the group , rather than manage each user individually.
Apply an IAM Password Policy: A Password policy dictates the format and expiration rules that must be followed when a user creates or   
    modifies their password.
The rules include passwords.
Any new or additional users created in AWS account are with NO access to anything by default (except the ability to login).
